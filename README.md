new 2025 vision:



Look,
geniuses.
you've made a lot of cool shit.
BUT YOU HAVEN'T COMBINED IT ALL
INTO ONE PROGRAM.

MAKE MY FUCKING MOVIE.

ONE FUCKING PROGRAM
THAT COMBINES ALL THE COOL SHIT.

HELLO, McFLY ?!!

btw, don't ask me to check all the little boxes on some comfy spaghetti.

fuck the fucking assenting micromanaging antfucking.

JUST MAKE MY FUCKING MOVIE.

ONE PROMPT, ONE MOVIE.

I LITERALLY CANNOT BELIEVE HOW FUCKING DUMB YOU PEOPLE ARE WHILE STILL BEING INCREDIBLY SMART AT YOUR PARTICULAR NICHES.

BUTT, I AM AN INTERDISCIPLINARY GENERALIST, SO...

MAYBE IT TOOK A GUY LIKE ME TO REALIZE
WHAT WAS MISSING.

NOW FOOLS ARE FINALLY STARTING TO THINK THEY CAME UP WITH IDEA THAT I HAD ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO.

AT THIS RATE, WE'LL HAVE A FULLY AUTOMATIC MOVIE MACHINE IN 10 YEARS.

WE SHOULD HAVE HAD IT TWO YEARS AGO.

SO FUCKING OBVIOUS!

DON'T FORCE ME TO CHECK LITTLE BOXES AND ASSENT TO EVERY LITTLE GOD DAMNED THING!

JUST MAKE IT!

MY PROTOTYPE IS STILL A FUCKING GOOD OUTLINE.

YOU FUCKING NERDS DON'T SEEM TO BE ABLE TO THINK LIKE A MOVIE PRODUCER.

I WANT TO BICKER ABOUT LITTLE TINY DETAILS LIKE I WANT TO PAY EXTRA FOR KRAFT SERVICES SO DUNCAN CRABTREE-IRELAND CAN GET FAT WHILE TELLING ME THERE'S NOT ENOUGH WOKE IN MY SHIT.

NO.

GET ER DONE.

YEAH, BUDDY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!









more to come, I hope....

// now 2024
// starting to work on 2.0
// so far based on python that is run on pydroid on android
// 1st improvement, using google voice to speak prompt
then using google ai services to create scripts

plan to convert to json

hopefully to avoid the parsing issues of the previous model

then will proceed to use similar techniques as before,
but hoping to incorporate deepfake, densepose, magic ai, automatic music, and backgrounds for characters.
