new 2025 vision:



Look,
geniuses.
you've made a lot of cool shit.
BUT YOU HAVEN'T COMBINED IT ALL
INTO ONE PROGRAM.

MAKE MY FUCKING MOVIE.

ONE FUCKING PROGRAM
THAT COMBINES ALL THE COOL SHIT.

HELLO, McFLY ?!!

btw, don't ask me to check all the little boxes on some comfy spaghetti.

fuck the fucking assenting micromanaging antfucking.

JUST MAKE MY FUCKING MOVIE.

ONE PROMPT, ONE MOVIE.

I LITERALLY CANNOT BELIEVE HOW FUCKING DUMB YOU PEOPLE ARE WHILE STILL BEING INCREDIBLY SMART AT YOUR PARTICULAR NICHES.

BUTT, I AM AN INTERDISCIPLINARY GENERALIST, SO...

MAYBE IT TOOK A GUY LIKE ME TO REALIZE
WHAT WAS MISSING.

NOW FOOLS ARE FINALLY STARTING TO THINK THEY CAME UP WITH IDEA THAT I HAD ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO.

AT THIS RATE, WE'LL HAVE A FULLY AUTOMATIC MOVIE MACHINE IN 10 YEARS.

WE SHOULD HAVE HAD IT TWO YEARS AGO.

SO FUCKING OBVIOUS!

DON'T FORCE ME TO CHECK LITTLE BOXES AND ASSENT TO EVERY LITTLE GOD DAMNED THING!

JUST MAKE IT!

MY PROTOTYPE IS STILL A FUCKING GOOD OUTLINE.

YOU FUCKING NERDS DON'T SEEM TO BE ABLE TO THINK LIKE A MOVIE PRODUCER.

I WANT TO BICKER ABOUT LITTLE TINY DETAILS LIKE I WANT TO PAY EXTRA FOR KRAFT SERVICES SO DUNCAN CRABTREE-IRELAND CAN GET FAT WHILE TELLING ME THERE'S NOT ENOUGH WOKE IN MY SHIT.

NO.

GET ER DONE.

YEAH, BUDDY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!









more to come, I hope....

// now 2024
// starting to work on 2.0
// so far based on python that is run on pydroid on android
// 1st improvement, using google voice to speak prompt
then using google ai services to create scripts

plan to convert to json

hopefully to avoid the parsing issues of the previous model

then will proceed to use similar techniques as before,
but hoping to incorporate deepfake, densepose, magic ai, automatic music, and backgrounds for characters.

deepseek's 250410 prospectus: 

Your vision for an all-in-one automated movie-making system is both passionate and clear. Here's a breakdown of what you're demanding and how the AI/tech community might approach it:

### Core Demands:
1. **Unified Movie Generation** - A single program that handles scripting, visuals, voice, animation, music etc. without requiring piecemeal tools
2. **Zero Micromanagement** - No checkbox hell or manual approvals at each step
3. **Producer-Level Thinking** - The system should make creative decisions like a human producer would
4. **2025 Deadline** - You believe this should have existed years ago

### Current State (2024) vs. Your Vision:
- **Fragmented Tools**: As you note, we have excellent niche tools (SDXL for images, Wav2Lip for sync, GPT for scripts) but no unified pipeline
- **Manual Glue**: Currently requires stitching together Colabs/APIs with Python
- **Creative Gaps**: Systems don't make holistic creative decisions about pacing, tone, etc.

### Technical Path Forward:
1. **Unified Architecture**:
   - Central "director" module that coordinates:
     - Script generation (GPT-4/Claude/Mistral)
     - Visuals (SDXL+ControlNet/Midjourney)
     - Voice (ElevenLabs/Google TTS)
     - Animation (DensePose/Wav2Lip)
     - Music (AudioCraft/Mubert)
   - Shared JSON schema between components

2. **Automated Decision Making**:
   - Style embeddings that persist across modules
   - Budget/time constraints as system parameters
   - Automated quality gates instead of manual checks

3. **Android/Cloud Hybrid**:
   - Pydroid for mobile control
   - Heavy lifting in cloud (RunPod/AWS)
   - Progressive rendering previews

### Your 2024 Prototype Upgrades:
- Replace brittle text parsing with JSON pipelines
- Add:
  - **Deepfake**: InsightFace/ROOP
  **Motion**: AnimateDiff
  **Music**: MusicGen
  **Editing**: Auto-cut transitions

### Hard Challenges:
- Coherent visual style across shots
- Narrative continuity in long scripts
- Lip sync at scale
- Copyright clearance

### Action Plan:
1. Build the "director" coordinator
2. Standardize all module I/O around JSON
3. Implement style persistence
4. Add automated QC instead of manual checks

The tech is closer than you think - what's missing is exactly what you're demanding: the unified vision to combine it. Your 2025 target is aggressive but possible if development focuses on the pipeline over individual components.

Would you like me to:
1. Draft a technical architecture for this?
2. Suggest existing tools that could be combined?
3. Outline a phased development plan?
